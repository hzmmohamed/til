Makefiles. They're everywhere. As usual, I was motivated to learn make through [N. Rougier](https://github.com/rougier)'s usage of it in the repository of his open source book **"Scientific Visualization: Python + Matplotlib"**. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book).

Makefile syntax is very much less verbose than other build tools. That makes it look cryptic to those who dive into one without reading the manual.

I didn't need to master it, rather only to learn the basic vocabulary. It's not a tool I've had to use so far, but I'd like to be able to understand other people's Makefiles.

[Makefile Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/) is a superb resource for just what I intended to do. It took about two hours to go through it. It turns out Make uses a rather modest set of basic features that can be combined to create complex building flows.

Here I try to summarize some of the key points I learned in bullet points:
- Basic for a build target(s) syntax is:
    target1 target2 : prerequisite1 prerequisite2
    command
    command
    command
- The commands will be ran once for each target and the target name is accessed by the [*automatic variable*](https://makefiletutorial.com/#automatic-variables) `$@`. There are, also, automatic variables for prerequisites and other things. The full list is [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html)
- Make uses files and timestamps to decide whether to re-run a built target. This perfectly serves the main use case of Make, which is C and C++ compilation. It even has built-in [implicit rules](https://makefiletutorial.com/#implicit-rules) dedicated to this use case.
  - Make expects that targets are files to be produced by the build commands. If the file is found, the target commands are not re-run.
  - Prerequisites are other targets.
  - Targets that don't have a file output should be defined in the `.PHONY` directive, e.g. `.PHONY: all clean`.

- Variables are defined using `src_files := file1 file2`. `src_files` takes the value `"file1 file2"`. There's a little more to variables. See [this section](https://makefiletutorial.com/#variables-pt-2).
- Each command is effectively run in a new shell. So no environment variables can be shared. However, there is support for passing env vars to command. See the tutorial for more details.
- Make supports aborting on, ignoring or suppressing errors in commands. See the [tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/#error-handling-with--k--i-and--) for more details.
- Wildcard matching is also supported.
